# P2P Discovery Comparison

*Written April 8th, 2019 by Dean Eigenmann*

**WARNING: This is an early draft, and likely contains errors.**

This document compares various protocols and methods used for peer discovery in p2p networks, with the intention of making it easier to choose one for any specific use case. It is part of a larger series on secure messaging, and therefore will likely contain certain biases towards that use case.
